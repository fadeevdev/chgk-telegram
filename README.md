![implementation concept](docs/concept.drawio.png "Implementation Concept")

Users(developers) will use telegram bot as a communication channel

Any user is able to register in telegram bot.

After registration a user can request for a random question taken from https://db.chgk.info/xml/random API. In parallel the question will be saved to internal service database (PostgeSQL)

Bot will print a random question and will start a timer waiting for an answer, in case of correct answer this will be added to database to keep a rating of users
